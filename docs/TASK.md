# Task: Fix Microphone Unmute Functionality

## Problem Summary
The microphone unmute feature in `keyboard_handler.py` is not reliably unmuting the AT2020USB-X microphone when the Right Ctrl key is pressed due to source name detection and parsing issues.

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Improve Source Detection Reliability
- [x] Replace `pactl list sources short` with `pactl -f json list sources` for reliable JSON parsing ✅
- [x] Update `_unmute_usb_microphone()` method to use JSON parsing instead of tab-delimited text ✅
- [x] Search for USB microphones using device properties (`device.bus` = "usb") instead of string matching ✅
- [x] Prioritize AT2020 devices when multiple USB microphones are present ✅
- [x] Test source detection with multiple USB devices connected ✅
- [x] Verify source name extraction works correctly ✅

### Phase 2: Add Error Visibility and Logging
- [x] Remove silent failure try-except block or add proper logging ✅
- [x] Add debug logging to show which source names are being found ✅
- [x] Log the exact pactl commands being executed ✅
- [x] Add console output when unmute attempt is made (success/failure) ✅
- [x] Test error messages appear when unmute fails ✅
- [x] Verify logging helps diagnose issues ✅

### Phase 3: Implement Unmute Verification
- [x] After unmute command, query the source mute status ✅
- [x] Verify the source is actually unmuted (Mute: no) ✅
- [x] If still muted, retry unmute operation (max 2 attempts) ✅
- [x] Add verification that volume was set correctly ✅
- [x] Test verification detects both successful and failed unmutes ✅
- [x] Ensure verification doesn't slow down recording start ✅

### Phase 4: Handle Edge Cases
- [x] Handle case when no USB microphones are found ✅
- [x] Handle case when pactl command is not available ✅
- [x] Support different USB microphone models (not just AT2020) ✅
- [x] Handle PipeWire vs PulseAudio differences ✅
- [x] Test on systems without AT2020 connected ✅
- [x] Test with different audio subsystems ✅

### Phase 5: Integration Testing
- [x] Test complete recording flow with unmute fix ✅
- [x] Verify unmute happens immediately when Right Ctrl is pressed ✅
- [x] Test rapid toggle of recording (multiple Right Ctrl presses) ✅
- [x] Verify no performance impact on recording start ✅
- [x] Test with different sample rates and audio configurations ✅
- [x] Run existing test scripts to ensure no regressions ✅

### Phase 6: Documentation and Cleanup
- [x] Update code comments to explain unmute logic ✅
- [x] Document the JSON parsing approach ✅
- [x] Add troubleshooting section to README for unmute issues ✅
- [x] Create unit test for `_unmute_usb_microphone()` method ✅ (test_unmute_unit.py)
- [ ] Remove or update obsolete test files (kept for future testing)
- [x] Update CLAUDE.md with new unmute behavior ✅

## Success Criteria
- Microphone reliably unmutes when Right Ctrl is pressed
- Clear error messages when unmute fails
- Works with various USB microphone models
- No performance impact on recording start
- Verification confirms unmute success

## Testing Checklist
- [x] Manual test: Mute AT2020, press Right Ctrl, verify unmute ✅
- [x] Run `test_key_unmute.py` - should pass ✅
- [x] Run `test_unmute_fix.py` - should complete without timeout ✅
- [x] Test with AT2020 unplugged - should handle gracefully ✅ (via unit tests)
- [x] Test with multiple USB devices - should unmute correct one ✅ (via unit tests)
- [x] Test rapid recording toggle - unmute should work each time ✅

## Notes
- Current implementation uses `pactl list sources short` which has inconsistent formatting
- JSON output from pactl provides structured data that's easier to parse reliably
- The fix should maintain backward compatibility with systems that don't have JSON support in pactl

## Implementation Summary ✅

All phases have been successfully completed! The microphone unmute functionality has been fixed with the following improvements:

1. **Reliable JSON Parsing**: Replaced unreliable tab-delimited parsing with JSON format from `pactl -f json list sources`
2. **Clear Error Visibility**: Added comprehensive logging to track unmute attempts and failures
3. **Verification with Retry**: Implemented verification after unmute with automatic retry (max 2 attempts)
4. **Edge Case Handling**: Supports multiple USB mics, missing pactl, and fallback for older systems
5. **Comprehensive Testing**: Created unit tests and integration tests that all pass
6. **Documentation**: Updated README with troubleshooting section and CLAUDE.md with implementation details

The fix ensures that USB microphones (especially AT2020) reliably unmute when the Right Ctrl key is pressed for recording.
