# System Shutdown Issues - Fixes Applied

## Overview
Successfully fixed all 5 major issues causing unexpected system shutdowns. The application is now much more stable and resistant to accidental exits.

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. ✅ ESC Key Double-Press Confirmation (PRIMARY FIX)
**File**: `keyboard_handler.py`
**Issue**: Single ESC press immediately exited the application
**Solution**: 
- Implemented double-press confirmation with 2-second timeout
- First ESC shows warning: "⚠️ Press ESC again within 2 seconds to exit"
- Second ESC within 2 seconds confirms exit
- Timeout automatically resets confirmation state
**Result**: No more accidental exits from ESC key

### 2. ✅ Graceful Device Selection Cancellation
**File**: `audio_device.py`, `voice_ptt.py`
**Issue**: Ctrl+C during device selection caused abrupt termination
**Solution**: 
- Custom `DeviceSelectionCancelled` exception instead of `sys.exit(0)`
- Main app catches exception and continues with default device
- Provides helpful user feedback on cancellation
**Result**: Can cancel device selection without killing the app

### 3. ✅ Intelligent AI Fix Restart Logic
**Files**: `startVoice_api.sh`, `startVoice_gpu.sh`
**Issue**: Infinite restart loop causing conflicts
**Solution**:
- Check exit codes before restarting (0=normal, 1=lock failed, other=crash)
- Don't restart on lock acquisition failures
- Exponential backoff: 2s, 4s, 8s, 16s, 32s
- Maximum 5 restart attempts
- Clear user feedback for each scenario
**Result**: No more restart conflicts or resource exhaustion

### 4. ✅ Robust Recording Thread Management
**File**: `voice_ptt.py`
**Issue**: Threads abandoned after 5-second timeout
**Solution**:
- Dynamic timeout: 30s base + 10s per minute of recording
- Thread state tracking with locks to prevent concurrent threads
- Force cleanup mechanism for abandoned threads
- Comprehensive logging with --debug flag
- Daemon threads ensure cleanup on process exit
**Result**: No more abandoned threads or resource leaks

### 5. ✅ Selective Trap Handlers
**Files**: `startVoice_api.sh`, `startVoice_gpu.sh`
**Issue**: EXIT trap caused cascading shutdowns
**Solution**:
- Removed EXIT from trap (only SIGINT and SIGTERM)
- Track specific process PIDs for targeted cleanup
- Check if process is running before killing
- Graceful termination with fallback to force kill
**Result**: Normal exits don't trigger full cleanup cascade

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Test ESC Key**: Press ESC once, verify warning appears, wait 3 seconds, verify no exit
2. **Test Double ESC**: Press ESC twice quickly, verify clean exit
3. **Test Device Cancel**: Press Ctrl+C during device selection, verify app continues
4. **Test AI Fix Lock**: Start multiple instances, verify second instance exits cleanly
5. **Test Long Recording**: Record for 2+ minutes, verify thread completes properly
6. **Test Normal Exit**: Use double-ESC to exit, verify clean shutdown

## Command Line Options Added

- `--debug`: Enable detailed logging for thread debugging in voice_ptt.py

## Stability Improvements

- **Accidental Exit Prevention**: Double-press confirmation for ESC
- **Resource Management**: Proper thread lifecycle and cleanup
- **Process Management**: Intelligent restart logic with backoff
- **Error Recovery**: Graceful handling of cancellations and failures
- **Signal Handling**: Selective trap handlers prevent cascades

## Next Steps

Consider implementing these long-term improvements:
1. State machine for application states (IDLE, RECORDING, PROCESSING)
2. Persistent logging to file for debugging
3. Configuration file for timeouts and retry settings
4. Status display showing current application state
5. Alternative exit key combination (e.g., Ctrl+Q)

## Summary

The system is now significantly more stable with deliberate exit conditions, proper resource management, and intelligent error recovery. Users should no longer experience unexpected shutdowns during normal use.
