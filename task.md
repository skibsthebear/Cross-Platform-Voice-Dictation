# Task: Implement Clipboard Restoration After Paste Operations

## Research Findings

### Current Pyperclip Usage in Codebase

The voice typing application uses pyperclip in two main locations:

1. **text_input.py:23** - Voice typing feature (Alt+R)
   - **Current behavior**: Copies transcribed text to clipboard and pastes it
   - **Issue**: Does NOT restore the previous clipboard content
   - **Impact**: User loses whatever they had copied before using voice typing

2. **ai-fix.py** - AI text formatting feature (Alt+G)
   - **TextCapture class (lines 79-98)**: ✅ Already implements clipboard restoration correctly
   - **TextReplacer class (line 201)**: ❌ Does NOT restore clipboard after replacement
   - **Issue**: AI-formatted text overwrites clipboard permanently

### Problem Summary

Users lose their previously copied content when using:
- Voice typing (Alt+R) - transcribed text overwrites clipboard
- AI text replacement (Alt+G) - formatted text overwrites clipboard

Only the AI text capture phase properly preserves clipboard content.

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Fix Voice Typing Clipboard Restoration
**File**: `text_input.py`

#### [x] Step 1.1: Save Original Clipboard Content
- [x] Import pyperclip at the top (already done)
- [x] In the `type_text()` method (around line 15), add clipboard backup before copying new text
- [x] Store original clipboard content in a variable before line 23

#### [x] Step 1.2: Add Error Handling
- [x] Wrap clipboard operations in try-except block
- [x] Ensure restoration happens even if pasting fails
- [x] Add appropriate error messages for debugging

#### [x] Step 1.3: Restore Clipboard After Pasting
- [x] After the paste operation (after line 34), restore the original clipboard content
- [x] Add a small delay before restoration to ensure paste completes
- [x] Test that the restoration works correctly

#### [x] Step 1.4: Update User Feedback
- [x] Modify the success message to indicate clipboard restoration
- [x] Consider adding debug output showing what was restored

### Phase 2: Fix AI Text Replacement Clipboard Restoration
**File**: `ai-fix.py`

#### [x] Step 2.1: Modify TextReplacer Class
- [x] In the `replace_selection()` method (around line 195), save original clipboard before line 201
- [x] Store the original clipboard content in a variable

#### [x] Step 2.2: Add Error Handling
- [x] Wrap the replacement operation in try-except block
- [x] Ensure clipboard restoration happens in both success and error cases
- [x] Follow the same pattern used in TextCapture class (lines 79-106)

#### [x] Step 2.3: Restore Clipboard After Replacement
- [x] After the paste operation (after line 210), restore the original clipboard content
- [x] Add appropriate delay to ensure replacement completes
- [x] Update success message to reflect clipboard restoration

### Phase 3: Testing and Validation

#### [x] Step 3.1: Test Voice Typing Clipboard Restoration
- [x] Copy some text to clipboard (e.g., "original text")
- [x] Use voice typing (Alt+R) to transcribe and paste new text
- [x] Verify that after pasting, the original text is back in clipboard
- [x] Test with empty clipboard
- [x] Test with special characters and Unicode text

#### [x] Step 3.2: Test AI Fix Clipboard Restoration
- [x] Copy some text to clipboard
- [x] Highlight text and use AI fix (Alt+G)
- [x] Verify original clipboard content is restored after replacement
- [x] Test with empty clipboard
- [x] Test error scenarios (AI service unavailable)

#### [x] Step 3.3: Integration Testing
- [x] Test both features in sequence to ensure they don't interfere
- [x] Test edge cases: very long clipboard content, binary data, etc.
- [x] Verify performance impact is minimal

### Phase 4: Code Quality and Documentation

#### [x] Step 4.1: Code Review
- [x] Ensure both implementations follow the same pattern
- [x] Check for code duplication and consider extracting common functionality
- [x] Verify error handling is consistent
- [x] Validate that all edge cases are covered

#### [x] Step 4.2: Update Documentation
- [x] Update CLAUDE.md to reflect the new clipboard restoration behavior
- [x] Add comments in the code explaining the restoration logic
- [x] Update any relevant docstrings

#### [x] Step 4.3: Final Validation
- [x] Run the complete application with both features
- [x] Test all keyboard shortcuts work as expected
- [x] Verify startup scripts still work correctly
- [x] Confirm no regressions in existing functionality

## Implementation Notes for Non-Programmers

### Key Concepts
- **Clipboard**: The temporary storage where copied text goes
- **Backup/Restore**: Saving the old clipboard content and putting it back later
- **Try-Catch**: Safety mechanism to handle errors gracefully

### Important Patterns to Follow
1. **Always backup before modifying**: Save clipboard content before changing it
2. **Always restore in finally**: Put back original content even if errors occur
3. **Add delays**: Small pauses ensure operations complete properly
4. **Test thoroughly**: Verify the feature works in all scenarios

### Files to Modify
1. `/home/skibrs/ZaWarudo/Work/Tools/voice_typing/text_input.py` - Voice typing
2. `/home/skibrs/ZaWarudo/Work/Tools/voice_typing/ai-fix.py` - AI text replacement

### Success Criteria
✅ Users can copy text, use voice typing, and still have their original text in clipboard  
✅ Users can copy text, use AI formatting, and still have their original text in clipboard  
✅ All existing functionality continues to work normally  
✅ Error handling prevents clipboard corruption
